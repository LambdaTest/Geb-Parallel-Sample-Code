     install maven
    ```

set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
```
Step 3. Make sure to install the mandatory Selenium dependencies for Maven by running the below command.
```
mvn compile
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
```
### Run Test with Single Configuration
```
$ mvn -Dlambdageb.capabilities="{\"build\": \"GebSingleTest\", \"platform\":  \"Windows 10\", \"browserName\": \"Chrome\", \"version\":\"latest\"}" clean test
```
   
### Run Parallel Test
Use the command below from the root of the project to run your tests.
```
$ run.sh
```
It will run the tests in your project with each of the configurations listed concurrently by configuration. i.e. all configurations will run at the same time. 
Individual test outputs will be routed to a log file named after the configuration in the project root folder. 
```bash
==> {"build": "GebParallelTest", "platform":  "OS X Yosemite", "browserName": "Chrome", "version":"72.0"}.log
```

### Advice/Troubleshooting
1. It may be useful to use a Java IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse to help troubleshoot potential issues.
